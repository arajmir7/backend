# Day 4 – Working with Python Libraries & Real Data

## What I Worked On Today
- Used Python’s built-in libraries to solve real problems
- Practiced array manipulation and string handling
- Built a small real-world data project without any external packages
- Fixed multiple real execution and environment issues

---

## Things I Learned

### 1. Using Python Built-in Libraries
- Read CSV files using `csv`
- Performed calculations using `math`
- Handled files and paths safely with `os` and `sys`
- Learned that many real tasks don’t need extra libraries

---

### 2. Arrays & Lists
- Rotating arrays efficiently
- Swapping elements to minimize operations
- Building patterns using nested lists
- Tracking frequency and positions in lists

---

### 3. File Handling (Very Important)
- Difference between **script location** and **working directory**
- Why `FileNotFoundError` happens
- How online judges handle output files differently
- Writing clean output to `.txt` files

---

### 4. Data Visualization Without Libraries
- Converted numbers into simple text-based charts
- Represented data visually using logic instead of graphics
- Understood how plotting libraries work internally

---

### 5. Debugging Skills Gained
- Fixed file path issues
- Solved encoding errors on Windows
- Learned why `/bin/python3` works on Linux but not Windows
- Understood online judge boilerplate code

---

## Mini Project Done Today

### Project Name
**Student Marks Data Visualizer**

### What It Does
- Reads student marks from a CSV file
- Calculates average, median, and spread
- Displays results as a text-based bar chart
- Saves output into a report file

### Why This Matters
- Mimics real backend data processing
- Shows how data tools work behind the scenes
- No external libraries used

---

## Key Takeaways
- Python’s standard library is powerful
- Understanding execution environment matters a lot
- Logic beats libraries when fundamentals are strong
- Small projects teach more than isolated problems

---

## Status
- Day 4 tasks completed
- Ready to move forward
