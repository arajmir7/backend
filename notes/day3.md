# Day 4 – Libraries, Arrays & Real-World Python Project

## Focus of the Day

Completed Unit 2 (Libraries & Frameworks) with hands-on problem solving and a real-world Python mini project. Also handled practical issues like file paths and encoding on Windows.

---

## Concepts Learned & Applied

### 1. Array Manipulation (CO2)

* Simulated NumPy-like array behavior using Python lists
* Practiced carry handling, matrix-style generation, and space optimization
* Understood reverse traversal and in-place updates

### 2. Algorithmic Optimization (CO2)

* Learned to detect invalid states early (New Year Chaos)
* Used constrained scanning to avoid TLE
* Applied greedy logic for minimum swaps

### 3. File Handling & CSV Processing (CO2)

* Read CSV files using Python’s built-in `csv` module
* Parsed structured data without pandas
* Learned difference between script location vs working directory
* Implemented path-safe file access using `os.path`

### 4. Math & Statistics (CO2)

* Calculated:

  * Mean
  * Median
  * Standard Deviation
* Used `math` module for variance and square root
* Applied statistical logic to real student data

### 5. Data Visualization without Libraries (CO6)

* Simulated matplotlib-style bar charts using ASCII
* Generated readable reports using text-based visualization
* Handled Unicode encoding issues on Windows using UTF-8

### 6. Real-World Debugging Skills

* Fixed `FileNotFoundError` by understanding working directories
* Fixed `UnicodeEncodeError` by enforcing UTF-8 encoding
* Understood platform differences (Windows vs Linux)

## Key Takeaways

* Python standard library is powerful enough for real applications
* Environment issues are as important as logic
* Writing robust, portable code is a backend developer skill
* Unit 2 outcomes (CO2 + CO6) are fully demonstrated
